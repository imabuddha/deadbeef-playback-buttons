## Playback Buttons

It is a plugin with two buttons which displays the current shuffle and loop mode and lets you change it with a mouse click.
To compile the plugin you need to copy the files deadbeef.h and gtkui_api.h from the deadbeef directory.

Copy the compiled plugin to the plugin folder (`~/.local/lib/deadbeef/`) and restart DeadDBeeF, then add the plugin to the gui.
